	<h1>Junior High School</h1>
	 <p id="pag1">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In my high school level, I learned many things from my subjects. It is fun and exciting and meeting new friends. We share jokes and laughter. Sometimes we are being scolded by our teachers due to being very talkative. Sometimes we dont listen to our lesson, sometimes we copy each others assignments and we tease each other. In the first day of my class i am so naughty with that my teacher caught me talking with my seatmates then she confornted me and giving some advice but most of them kay isog na pag ka talk so i was scared that time because maybe she might have a heart atttack caused by his age. I was afraid of it because maybe she will let me out of her class so what i did is I just sit i still remain calm but deep inside im already peeing. I regret of what happened last 2015 I guess.

  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAlthough its been a long time but the trauma is still here. Anyways i have lost of friends since elementary, maybe most of them are my classmate. After 3 months christmas season is near so what we did is to perform a dance with the concept of Chirstmas. It was funny because i did not attended some of the practice so the leader placed me at the back so I just follow the steps but wa jd nagkadimao akon sayaw. Altough  my performance is not good but our performance is still successfull. Dec 20  guess we had our chirstmass party we shared our boan and then we exchanged gifts. Later on i met this teacher named Lou Ann she was very kind and loving teacher she understands and accepts of whay i am. So  with change for that i help her with her plants, cleaning he classroom and more. Even i am too naughty Ms. Lou ann still accepts me and the was the first teacher i admire like she was my inspiration. I want all teachers be like her. Because some of the teacher misjudge the students by looking at their physical appreance they didint look at thier inner self. We should also consider their emotions some of the teacher always mad with their students without knowing their experiences or what they went trhough. Anyways it was a rollercoaster ride full of learnings and memories.

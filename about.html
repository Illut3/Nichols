	<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIm Nichols Illut. Im from Bantayan Island, Santa Fe, Cebu. Im 20 Yrs. old. I do love playing Volleyball, Badminton, And Table Tennis. I graduated in Santa Fe National High School. Well, I do love walking together with my dogs namely Frappe, Rocky, and ChamCham. I had three dogs before but because of distemper they didnt survive. A paramyxovirus causes distemper in dogs, and it is closely related to the measles and rinderpest viruses. It causes severe illness in the host by attacking multiple body systems, resulting in a widespread infection that is difficult to treat. Its like a cancer in dogs. So we have nothing to do because the virues has already spread. But life must go on. I also love cats but i dont have any cats in our house. In my high school years i joined and organizations like Campus Press. Campus Press help me a lot in improving my skills in Photography. This organization help me discover my passion. A passion that leads me to a brighter way.

		<br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In Photography it has hugebimpact to myself because i can earn money with just a click. I also cover some Short Films, Book, Debuts, Wedding, Prenups, and other community events. It help me to but something that i want. Although buying some expensive stuff in not enough with just one click so you should save more money so that you can buy whatever you want. Although it takes some time but all you have to do is to have a patience and a work smart. When the pandemic started we also do some bike stuffs. I joined some Bike Race. I met some new people and became my friends they are the people that help me to get out of my shell. So with that i created and then even though Im busy or cannot joined some group ride but still it was well organized. The people were too disciplined and also they are loyal to the group. <br>

		Actually my first Course is Veterinary i dont know why i shift into an IT it always run in my mind that if i can supass this course. Im struggling in one of the major subject. I dont know what to do. I always ended watching the walls and lying in my bed. Im just staring into nothing. I dont know if i regretted or its just a karma for myself. I always overthink that what if i fail one of my subject, I dont know what to do if i pursue this course or not. Im a type of person that I dont like failing subjects because I dont want them to downgrade me, I dont want to recieve some opinions because once i receieve one of those i added it to my thinking like they worsen it. Although i studied hard but i still got low scores. But todays generation not all weather will be in your favor. Anyways college is not that easy. It helps you getting stronger and wiser about the challenges youd face. It is what it is.

<h1>Elementary</h1>
<b> <p id="pag1">My elementary school years were exciting and enjoyable. It's both challenging and exciting.
Elementary school is full of memorable memories that taught you to appreciate small things.
It was difficult to balance sports and academics, but you will get used to it in the days ahead. Although it is difficult but, to be honest it was so fun meeting new friends from various parts of the Cebu and having a memorable experience. What matters most is that I learned and I am proud to have completed it. </p> </b>

<b> <p id="pag2"> Elementary school was kindergarten through fourth grade and there is very little I remember. I don’t remember going home and reading to my grandparents or playing with anyone at recess or biting my nails when I was made to talk in front of my classmates, but I know I did. There are pictures of elementary school me with big smiles and bitten down nails. There’s this memory I have of writing my name in cursive and being told, rather harshly, that I was not to do that again because we were not being taught that. I remember biting my nails and nodding and struggling to remember cursive letters in later years. But I also remember a classmate cutting my finger so bad it was barely hanging on and then going back to class just fine with a band aid on. I don’t know if either is a real memory, but the more I think about it the more I realize that I don’t write in cursive and my finger is doesn’t really matter And also there was time that my friend are being haunted by our room some of my classmates are scared but for for me its was a very satisfying. So me and may classmate collaborating and brainstorming about what happened so what we did is doing some experiment that keep the ghost's away so we made some holy water, garlic and salt so we mixed it after we put it in a bottle spray then we went to our room sprayed it in  the wall we sprayed it the whole room so there are some extra sa amo gi mix we sprayed it to the other rooms so that we can assure that we are safe. That was a memorable experience for me because that time was the only way i can talk with my crush so as time goes by we went to a near bakeshop then i ordered some drinks. Thats it that was the time that happiness can only found through experiment. I don’t have vivid memories of happiness or sadness, but I know they were both there and sometimes I wish I could go back simply so I could know what was concrete, I don’t think any of my memories are true.

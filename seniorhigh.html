<h1>Senior High School</h1>
 <p id="pag1"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is how my senior high school life started , first day of school. I felt excited and nervous. Excited in such a way that I will be able to experience another journey of my life. Nervous in the sense that I will be facing new classmates , new teachers and new friends . Nevertheless , the nervous I felt in the first day slowly gone and filled with happiness. I was able to gained new friends . Most of them are my schoolmate and some of them are transferees from other school. I really thought that my senior high school would be very boring ,but I was wrong.  I don’t expect that I would be enjoying with my new friends and my classmates. I really treasure every single days with them , with their craziness in life. 

<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the days passed by, I experienced lots of new things in my life . I was able to eat with my classmates and teacher in what we called “bodol fight”. You’ll be eating with your bare hands only ,no using using of spoons and forks. The foods are placed together in a big banana leaves. I really enjoy eating with themIn my Senior days i am being bullied by my fellow students because of my teeth it was so destructive ive lost my confidence in talking to other people but then met my friends and with that their were so good to me they cheer me up through my downs. I knwo being bullied has a big impact to us it gives us trauma but one thng I learned during my senior days is to not pay attention just have fun and make your senior day memorable and gladly i made it i completed and i am so proud of it even there are some barriers you still succeed and you strive.
